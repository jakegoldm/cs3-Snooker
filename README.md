This project was completed for Caltech's CS 3: Introduction to Software Design course. The primary language of this course was C. This project includes a series of demos completed in groups of 4. This also includes a game, Snooker, that was completed over a three-week period. The demos can be viewed by including them in the Makefile. The demos/game can be run by using `make NO_ASAN=true all`.
